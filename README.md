# OpenAI Doom

This is an AI made to play Doom, the FPS game from 1993. The AI learns to play the game Doom, and gets better after each round. The AI uses a deep convolutional Q-learning network, a subset of reinforcement learning. 

## Mechanics and Measurements
The code produces videos which allows the user to view the AI's progression in the game. Initially, the AI will die immediately. But as it learns to move and shoot (it has 7 actions available to it), the AI will find the best way to get from A to B. The best means fastest time possible without getting hurt/killed.


## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 2. You will need PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this. Just fork the repo, download and play!
